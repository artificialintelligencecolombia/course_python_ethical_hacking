Provides detailed info about the network interfaces on a Linux machine.

---------------------
eth0
---------------------

- Represents a physical or virtual network interface (Network Interface Card) (hardware -> network card).
- Connects the system to a LAN or the internet.
- The interface has a unique MAC address.
- The interface has an IP address.
- Emulates a physical NIC.

> Note: with NAT mode in the virtual machine, eth0 uses the host's IP address for external communications, while hiding the VM's internal IP.

eth0 Flags and Status
---------------

eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500

- UP: The interface is operational.

- BROADCAST: The interface supports broadcasting. sending data to all nodes in 	a local network.

- RUNNING: The interface has been started and can be used.

- MULTICAST: The interface supports multicasting. (sending data to a group of destination computers).

- MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit): 1500: largest packet size that can be sent over this network interface, measured in bytes.

- IPv4 Address:
	- inet 192.168.11.128: The IPv4 address assigned to the interface.
	- netmask 255.255.255.0: The subnet mask associated with the IPv4 address. which determines the network portion of the address.
	- broadcast 192.168.11.255: The broadcast address for the subnet, used for sending messages to all devices on the network.

- IPv6 Address:
	- inet6 fe80::20c:29ff:fe25:49db: The IPv6 address assigned to the interface.
	- prefixlen 64: The length of the subnet mask in bits for IPv6.
	- scopeid 0x20<link>: The scope of the address (link-local in this case).
- MAC Address (Ethernet Address):

	- ether 00:0c:29:25:49:db: The hardware address of the interface.
- Transmission Queue Length:
	- txqueuelen 1000: The length of the transmission queue.
	
- Packet Statistics:
	- RX packets 504856: Number of received packets.
	- bytes 750259974 (715.5 MiB): Amount of data received.
	- RX errors 0: Number of receive errors.
	- dropped 0: Number of dropped packets.
	- overruns 0: Number of receive overruns.
	- frame 0: Number of framing errors.
	- TX packets 22108: Number of transmitted packets.
	- bytes 2221500 (2.1 MiB): Amount of data transmitted.
	- TX errors 0: Number of transmission errors.
	- dropped 0: Number of dropped transmitted packets.
	- overruns 0: Number of transmission overruns.
	- carrier 0: Number of carrier losses.
	- collisions 0: Number of collisions detected.

lo
---------------

- Its the virtual interface that the system uses to communicate with itself.
- Crucial for testing, development and running network services locally.
